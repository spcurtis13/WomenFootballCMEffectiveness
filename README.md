This project is a fascinating exploratory analysis that delves into the effectiveness of center midfielders in the Women's Super League during the 2018-2019 season. The project relies on Statsbomb data, which exclusively tracks players' positions during significant events such as shots, passes, and tackles. While this data restriction limited the scope of the project, it ultimately proved beneficial, allowing for a closer examination of the center midfielders' offensive impact.

To develop the center midfielders' ratings, the project relied on several basic statistics that Statsbomb recorded throughout the season, such as goals, errors, and key passes. However, to provide additional nuance, the project also developed two composite statistics, including incomplete backward passes and forward passes completed in zones 5 and 8.

It's worth noting that zones 5 and 8 are located on the defensive side of the soccer pitch and are depicted in the accompanying diagram. By analyzing forward passes completed in these zones, the project gained valuable insights into which center midfielders were truly excelling in the modern pressing game.

It's worth noting that while zone 14, highlighted in red, is typically seen as a key area for generating a team's best chances in modern coaching, I made a deliberate choice not to focus on it. This is because the data already captured a wealth of valuable information about the team's performance in this zone, reflected in key passes made and goals scored.

Instead, I turned my attention to zones 5 and 8 on the defensive side of the field. By analyzing completed passes that were both forward and over 10 meters, I was able to gain insight into which players were truly excelling. In today's game, where pressing is a common strategy, being able to beat the opposition's pressure is a crucial skill for any center-mid.

Despite the limited nature of the data available and my basic analysis approach, aggregating all the information together to form my ratings proved highly effective. I was able to accurately identify the top players in the league while also rewarding those who put their team in good positions, even if they didn't necessarily make the final or penultimate pass.

Looking to the future, I plan to revisit this project and explore the more offensive nature of incisive passes that can split open a defense. With increased familiarity with the data and tools like Pandas, I'm confident I can introduce greater nuance and sophistication to my analysis in future iterations.
